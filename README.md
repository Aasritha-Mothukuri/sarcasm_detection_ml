# Sarcasm Detection Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically detect sarcasm in text.
Detecting sarcasm is a challenging but important task in natural language processing (NLP), as it helps improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, and overall language understanding in AI systems.
